# Github-Grader
Leverages gRPC and Data Manipulation to compute a "grade" for a designated github account

# Usage
Run `python server.py` in one terminal and `python grader.py {username}` in another.

# Disclaimer
I did this project to learn gRPC services, the actualy grading and data collection workflows can definitely be refined.
